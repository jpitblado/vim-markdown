# markdown.vim

Some mappings I find useful while editing Markdown files.

## Installation

I use [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)
to install Vim plugins.
If you do too, then you can use the following to install this plugin:

```
cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone https://github.com/jpitblado/vim-markdown.git
```

Also add `~/.vim/bundle/vim-markdown/bin` to your path.

## Future plans

Documentation for the mappings.
